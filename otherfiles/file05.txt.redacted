On the morning of ████ ██ █████ ███████ I received a █████████ call at ████ A. ██ a ████ voice stated “is this ████ I said no it is █████ ██ said this is the █████ something, terrible has happened to ████████ I think it is murder - I said "where are you” ██ said at ███ ██████████ house and add get the ambulance and get over here right away. I hung up the █████ and told ████ ████████ the fireman on duty that the mayor said that there was a murder at the ██████████ home, and that we are leaving, they should come right away. I told █████████ █████ █████████ to take the other police ███████ and follow me over. I arrived at the ██████████ home at about ████ A. ██ █████ ████ or ███ wife, ██████ ████ met me at the ████ ████ ████████ the door enters into a hall and so I entered this door way directly in front of me in the hall was a black leather ████████ bag, standing on it's end facing me with it's ████████ spilled out - I walked directly to a study which was to my right or on the ████ side of the hall - I looked into the study and saw ███ ███ ████████ half lying and half sitting in a large red leather chair, I believe: I heard ██████ ████ say ███ upstairs and see what you can do for █████████ ███ directed me into the kitchen which was directly opposite the study on the west side of the entrance hall, through the kitchen to a stairway which goes up █████ flights of stairs to a landing, and then █████ steps down into the living room, the stairs leading up stairs from the center landing. ███ Followed me upstairs – directly at the head of the stairs there is a bed­room- I entered this room and observed twin beds, ████ poster type, on the bed closest to the door I entered I found the body of ████ ███████ █████████ ███ was lying with ███ head about █████ feet from the head board on ███ back, with ███ right arm lying beside ████ and ███ left arm folded over ███ stomach - the legs were bent at the knees protruding over the outer edge of the bed, beneath a cross bar. I observed ████ lacerations on ███ forehead, considerable clotted blood about ███ hair and face. The upper part of ███ body from ███ stomach to ███ neck was covered with a checked blouse or shirt; the lower part of ███ body was covered with bed clothing; exposing only ███ stomach. ███ appeared to be dead at that time. Making an observation of the room I observed shades were drawn; there was blood Spots on the door leading to the bedroom which was open; there was some cloths lying and hanging on a rocker at the foot of the bed in which ███ was lying, there were ███ pairs of ██████ shoes; ███ pair was a white moccasin type, the other pair blue oxford ██████ shoes. It immediately went downstairs and outside to the police car and radioed for a doctor be sent immediately and that █████ of ███████ ████ ██████ and ████ ███ ██████ be notified and come up. At this time I had informed that ███ ███████ ████████ had been called already and was on ███ way - I then went to the house and to the study where ███ ███ was, ██ was still sitting in the red leather chair, ██ had no shirt or under shirt, ██ wore a pair of brown trousers. I also observed discoloration at the right side of ███ face at the eye which was swelling; there was evidence of a swelling at the right cheek at the corner of the mouth, I inquired as to, what had happened and ██ related that ██ did not know, ██ had heard ███████ scream, that ██ was fighting on the stairs; that ██ was in the water; that ██ came upstairs, at this time ██ clasped both hands at the back of ███ neck; and turned ███ head and said nothing more. Meanwhile the members of the ███ ███████ ████ ██████████ arrived; ███████ ████ ███████ and █████████ ███████ ██████ ████████ were up stairs with the stretcher in the bedroom- As I was coming down the stairs I met ██████ ███████ ████████ coming in the hall from the ████ ████ ████ █████████ ███ ███████ ████████ went over to the study and looked in at ███ ███ ████████ and I directed ███ to come with me upstairs immediately, ██ proceeded me up the stairs and on the way ██ asked for some kitchen knifes, I reached back and gave ███ █████ kitchen knifes off the rack above the sink in the kitchen, ██ entered the room turning on the light; ██ walked around the bed in between the twin beds; ██ examined ████ in a professional manner; ██ replaced the instruments in ███ bag, an returned the kitchen knifes to mea and then went down stairs and went to the study where ███ ███ ████████ was. I then informed █████ ███████ ████ that I felt that we needed some assistance, and asked that the █████████ ██████ ████████ ██████████ be notified as well as ███ ███ ███████ ██████ ████████ █████ ████ agreed that this would be ████ shortly thereafter upon the arrival of █████ ██████ ████ ███ ton I called the █████████ ██████ █████████ ██████ and the ████████ ██████ to obtain the █████ number of ███ ███████ ██████ whom I notified. I then searched the premises for the weapon and other evidence; I made an examination of the premises. I went in the upper yard and down approximately █████ steps to a porch surrounding a beach house from here I could observe the beach in both directions and there was no evidence to indicate that there might have been a struggle or foot prints on the beach, on returning up the stairs I saw the third step from the top several water blotches continuing up to the lawn, going into the porch and into the living room I observed a small pool of water on the threshold between the porch and living room. At about ████ ████ I was joined by █████ of ██████ ████ █████ and ████ ███ ███████ I continued to look about the home and on the stairway and the landing leading upstairs there was small pools of water. At this time I noticed that ███ █████ █████████ ███ ███ ██████████ ████████ was present in the study, and while conversing with ████ ██████ I saw ████ ███████ █████████ and ███████ █████████ ███ escorting ███ ███ ██████████ ███ ███████ also known as Chip out the door leading to ████ █████ A short time later █████████ ███████ █████████ of the █████████ ██████ ██████████ arrived and along with ███ we searched the premises for possible evidence for a forcible entry before taking photos of the victim and scene. At this point ███ ███ ██████ arrived, made an examination of the bed and then ordered the remains sent to the county ███████ Shortly after the body was conveyed to ██████ ██████ by █████ ███████████ ████ ██████████ ███ ███ ████████ was then taken to ███ ████ ████████ by ███ ███████ ██████████ in ███ car - Together with █████████ ██████ ██████████ ██████████ ███████ ██████ and ██████ █████████ we made █████████ search and examination of the property. Later on that day I went to ███ ███████ ████████ and photographed the face of ███ ███ ████████ but had no conversation with ████ That day I also took photos of the home interior. ██ What was the condition of the doors ███ at the ████ ████ entrance of the ████████ home when you first arrived? ██ I would say the screen door was closed but not locked, the inner door was open, and I was admitted by ████ ██████ █████ ██ ████████ the wearing apparel found in ███████ ██████████ room near the rocker when you arrived? ██ There were ███ pairs of shoes, ███ pair being white moccasin type, the other pair being a dark oxford ██████ type shoe, along side there laid a pink panty, on the rocker there was a pair of white shorts, a white bra, ███ sweaters ███ of which was white, the other I believe was blue, a ███████ ██████ belt, a white or beige mans shirt was hanging on ███ edge of the rocker, over this hung a pair of blue shorts. ██ ███ ████ lights were on when you reached this bedroom? ██ I observed no lights when I reached the bedroom. ██ Who called ███ ███████ ████████ to the scene? ██ To the best of my knowledge, █████ ████ did. ██ ████████ the condition of the living room on your arrival? ██ The door leading from the dinning area of the ███ shaped living room on the █████ side of the house, leading on to the porch the door was half way open the screen door leading from the porch, to the lawn was fully open.
