███ evidence lifted from a discarded cigarette led ███████ police to the ███ they believe killed a young ██████ ██ years ago, authorities said █████████ █████ ████████ █████████ then ███ had just left a ███ ██████ ███ celebration before ███ was strangled and sexually assaulted in ██████████ allegedly by ██████ ███████ ██████ now ███ according to police. "I didn't really know if this [arrest] would ever happen," the victim's relieved ███████ █████ ███████ ███ a nurse, told ███ ████ on █████████ "I didn't really think this would happen in my lifetime, not after ██ years." Detectives said they spoke to dozens of friends and other revelers at ████████ ███ & ███████ not far from where ████████ was found on ████ ██ █████ But for most of the time, they had no suspect in the killing of █████████ who was survived by an ████████████ ████ "Despite having a good bit of physical evidence and dozens of interviews, over time, the trail went cold," police said in a statement █████████ "It seems that every couple of years a new lead would pop up and we would drop everything to run it down. We did this time and time again. In the meantime, a baby ███ grew up without a ███████ parents buried their ████████ without knowing justice, and a killer was walking around free. " But ███ in a public database eventually linked ██████████ killer to ██████ family and then to ████ police said. Investigators were secretly following █████ on █████ █ when ██ tossed a cigarette out of ███ car, according to an arrest warrant. ██████ "immediately stopped and recovered the cigarette butt," which had ███ matching semen taken off the victim's body, according to the warrant. "Each time, evil won, just out of reach," police said of the ███████ gap. "Until ██████ Today, the evil that took █████ from ███ friends and family was arrested for ███ brutal murder." ██████ ███ is being offered to other nearby law enforcement agencies with unsolved sex crimes because ██ has lived locally the whole time, █████████ police spokesman ████ ████ said. "The reasons why this happened, how evil crossed ███████ path, ███ never be answered and in the end ███ not be important," according to police. "What is important is that no ███ forgot ██████ " █████ was booked into the ████████ ██████ ████ on █████████ and held without bail. ██ has been charged with murder and sexual battery. It wasn't immediately clear whether █████ had hired or been assigned an attorney, ████ said █████████ ██████ said █████ pleased about the arrest in ███ sister's case — but saddened that ███ dad died a decade ago without knowing that ███ ██████████ alleged killer would someday be caught. "It weighed a lot on ████ ███ was always ███ favorite," ██████ said of this bittersweet day.
